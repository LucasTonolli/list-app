- Vue Router navigation patterns

---

## ✨ Features

- Create multiple lists
- Add, toggle and remove items
- Switch between lists
- Empty states handling
- Mobile-first UI
- Dialog-based interactions
- Not Found route handling

````

### Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧠 Architectural Notes

* Global state is handled via a **composable (`useLists`)**
* Views are responsible for:

  * Routing
  * Fetching data from composables
* Components are:

  * Dumb / presentational
  * Communicate via props and emits
* Dialogs expose their API using `defineExpose`

---

## 📌 Future Ideas

* Persist data (LocalStorage or API)
* List sharing via hash links
* Edit list items
* Animations for list changes
* Keyboard accessibility improvements
